### Predicting drug targets from tumor-derived scRNA-seq data

In this project, we will be using a scRNA-seq dataset (.loom) from the NIH National Cancer Institute GDC portal. This data was generated by Illumina 10X Chromium sequencing and sampled from a White woman (Non-Hispanic/Latino) with Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

The workflow for this project is as follows:

1. Pre-process data:

- Ingest a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset
- Annotate appropriately
- Normalize & scale data (log-transform)
- Data exploration (highly variable genes, gene set enrichment analysis)
- Filter data (for highly variable genes to reduce dimensionality)
- Label data with druggable targets (present or not in Open Targets list: positive and negative class)


2. Train AI model:

- Instantiate, train and test supervised learning model to predict gene targets associated with drug efficacy
- Evaluate model performance
- Iterate on data and model optimization

By the end of this project, we will have designed a reproducible end to end Bioinformatics single-cell pipeline, incorporating data pre-processing and analysis, model building, evaluation and optimization.
